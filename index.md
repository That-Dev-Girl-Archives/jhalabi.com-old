## Developer of web sites. Baker of cookies.

This corner of the web houses my personal digital life â€“ [photos](/photos) I have taken, [books](/books) I have read, and other such randomness. My [resume](/resume) is also here, but this site is primarily for my non-tech life. _(I have a non-tech life?!)_

On the sweeter side, I have not yet mastered the art of digitizing dessert, so unfortunately, there are no samples available for download at this time.
