My daughter is only a few days old, but over the course of the past few days, I have been calling her by all sorts of nicknames. On top of that, my friends have also been donning her with even more nicknames. This girl has so many nicknames flying around, that I decided I needed to record all of these names somewhere.

* Missy
* Little miss
* My little string bean
* Girly
* Girly girl
* Cutie
* Burrito
* Honey
* Little miss squirmy
